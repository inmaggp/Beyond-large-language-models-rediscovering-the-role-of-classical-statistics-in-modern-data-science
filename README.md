This repository includes the dataset used in the article presented at the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence 2024. It also provides the results obtained after applying different zero-shot classification models, along with a statistical analysis of the differences between them
- dataset.xlsx contains the set of 90 texts with all the classification scores provided by each combination of model-hypothesis-topic
- DOE.xlsx contains all the results of the experimental design of repeated measures with three within-subject factors and one between-subject factor.
- Residuals.pdf contains the graphical representation of the residuals of all the 3x4x3=36 different combinations of the levels of the within-subject factors.
